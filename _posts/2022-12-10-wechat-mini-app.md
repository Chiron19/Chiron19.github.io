## Introduction
This is a software project based on webpage programming (HTML, JS, CSS). 

WeChat is a very popular chatting app in China mainland, intergrating social media, e-payment and mini-app. WeChat mini-app allows user to utilize light scale programs without installing addtional APPs. Meanwhile, it works with built-in WeChat functions to free users from a troublesome process of registration, authentication or payment method selection.

During 2020 Autumn ~ 2021 Spring, we, a group of 6 members, worked as a team on the project of a WeChat mini-app to better promote our Q-makers club and provide useful information, serving as a webpage.

Due to the missing original code and the discontinous payment of database storage, this project is no longer maintained. However we have gained necessary and precious knowledge through it.

## Demo Presentation
Here are some screenshots of it, showing the main functionality of each part.

The homepage automatically fetches the news from the university official website. The banner is a circular slide-show of photo collection in the news. When clicking into a banner or a title of news, it would fetch the content of the news and navigate to the detail page.
