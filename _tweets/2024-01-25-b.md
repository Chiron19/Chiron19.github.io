### 西文測試

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

### 中文测试

天地玄黃， 宇宙洪荒。 日月盈昃， 辰宿列張。

寒來暑往， 秋收冬藏。 閏餘成歲， 律呂調陽。

雲騰致雨， 露結為霜。 金生麗水， 玉出崑崗。

劍號巨闕， 珠稱夜光。 果珍李柰， 菜重芥薑。

海鹹河淡， 鱗潛羽翔。 龍師火帝， 鳥官人皇。

始制文字， 乃服衣裳。 推位讓國， 有虞陶唐。

弔民伐罪， 周發殷湯。 坐朝問道， 垂拱平章
